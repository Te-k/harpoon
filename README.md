OSINT / Threat Intel CLI tool.

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/harpoon)](https://pypi.org/project/harpoon/) [![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/harpoon)](https://pypistats.org/packages/harpoon) [![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/harpoon)](LICENSE) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/te-k/harpoon)](https://github.com/Te-k/harpoon/issues)

# Install

## Requirements

As a pre-requesite for Harpoon, you need to install [lxml](https://lxml.de/installation.html) requirements, on Debian/Ubuntu : `sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev`.

You need to have [geoipupdate](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate) installed and [correctly configured](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoipupdate/) to use geolocation correctly (make sure you to have `GeoLite2-Country GeoLite2-City GeoLite2-ASN` as `EditionIDs`).

If you want to use the screenshot plugin, you need phantomjs and npm installed:

```
npm install -g phantomjs
```

## Installing harpoon

You can simply install the package from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/harpoon/) with `pip install harpoon`

If the above install instructions didn't work, you can build the tool from source by executing the following commands in the terminal (this assumes you are using virtualenvs):

```
git clone https://github.com/Te-k/harpoon.git
cd harpoon
pip3 install .
```

You may want to install [harpoontools](https://github.com/Te-k/harpoontools) to have additional commands using harpoon features.

## Updating harpoon

Check if you have the latest version running:

```
git pull origin master
```

Reinstall the binary:

```
pip install .
```

In case you are missing some plugins or modules (ex: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named "pygreynoisev1"`). You need to add those modules to your Python environement as such:

```
pip install NAME_OF_THE_MODULE
```

You can also upgrade `pip` (but this shouldn't change the way you do the steps
described above):

```
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Configuration

To configure harpoon, run `harpoon config` and fill in the needed API keys.

Then run `harpoon update` to download needed files. Check what plugins are configured with `harpoon config -c`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Te-k/harpoon/wiki) for more information.
